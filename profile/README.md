# Health and Medical Security (HMS) Lab

## Who we are
The Health and Medical Security (HMS) Lab at Johns Hopkins University conducts cybersecurity research focused on protecting patient safety and strengthening trust in modern healthcare technologies.

The HMS Lab was founded more than a decade ago under Professor Emeritus Avi Rubin, pioneering research at the intersection of security and medicine.

Today, the lab has been renewed under Dr. Michael Rushanan, bringing industry-facing insight into medical device security engineering, software supply chain risk (including SBOMs), applied cryptography, and hands-on “break it to build it” security education.

## Mission
The HMS Lab advances the security, safety, and resilience of health technologies through rigorous, hands-on cybersecurity research and education. We build practical tools and evidence-driven insights to help manufacturers, clinicians, regulators, and researchers design medical systems that are secure-by-design.

All of our research output is transparent (open source) and reproducible. Any findings that may impact patient safety are managed through responsible disclosure procedures before releasing public artifacts.
